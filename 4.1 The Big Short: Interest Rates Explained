#equation  𝑙𝑝+𝑥(1−𝑝)=0 . Note that this equation is the definition of expected value given a loss per
#foreclosure  𝑙  with foreclosure probability  𝑝  and profit  𝑥  if there is no foreclosure (probability  1−𝑝 ).
#We solve for  𝑥=−𝑙𝑝1−𝑝  and calculate  𝑥 :

x = - loss_per_foreclosure*p/(1-p)

#On a $180,000 loan, this equals an interest rate of:
x/180000
